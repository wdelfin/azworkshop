This architecture is appropriate for relatively simple domains that include some resource-intensive tasks. It is easy to understand and benefits from managed services that simplify deployment and operations. However, in complex domains, managing dependencies can be difficult, and both the front end and worker components can become large, monolithic, and hard to maintain or update.

Dependencies are managed by\\n\\ndividing the application into layers that perform logical functions, such as presentation, business\\n\\nlogic, and data access. A layer can only call into layers that sit below it. However, this horizontal\\n\\nlayering can be a liability. It can be hard to introduce changes in one part of the application\\n\\nwithout touching the rest of the application. That makes frequent updates a challenge, limiting\\n\\nhow quickly new features can be added.\\n\\nN-tier is well-suited for migrating existing applications that already use a layered architecture. For\\n\\nthat reason, N-tier is most often seen in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions or applications\\n\\nthat use a combination of IaaS and managed services.\\n\\nWeb-Queue-Worker\\n\\nIdentity\\nProvider\\n\\nRemote\\nService\\n\\nClient\\n\\nWeb Front\\nEnd\\n\\nCache\\n\\nWorker\\n\\nDatabase\\n\\nQueue\\n\\nCDN\\n\\n\\uf80a\\nStatic\\nContent\\n\\nFor a purely PaaS solution, consider a Web-Queue-Worker architecture. In this style, the\\n\\napplication has a web front end that handles HTTP requests and a back-end worker that performs\\n\\nCPU-intensive tasks or long-running operations. The front end communicates to the worker\\n\\nthrough an asynchronous message queue.\\n\\nWeb-Queue-Worker is suitable for relatively simple domains with some resource-intensive tasks.\\n\\nLike N-tier, the architecture is easy to understand. Managed services simplify deployment and\\n\\noperations. But with complex domains, it can be hard to manage dependencies. The front end\\n\\nand the worker can easily become large, monolithic components that are hard to maintain and\\n\\nupdate.

    "\n",
    "1. PURPOSE\n",
    "   - Use the supplied DOCUMENT_CHUNK to answer user questions.\n",
    "   - Allow simple greetings and light chitchat.\n",
    "   - If the user's question is outside the scope of DOCUMENT_CHUNK, respond with a polite refusal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INPUT FORMAT\n",
    "   The model always receives two inputs in this order:\n",
    "   a) DOCUMENT_CHUNK: A block of text containing the relevant information.\n",
    "   b) USER_QUERY: The user's message or question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BEHAVIOR\n",
    "   a) Greetings & Chitchat\n",
    "      - If USER_QUERY is a greeting (e.g. “hi”, “hello”, “good morning”) or simple chitchat (“how are you?”, “what's up?”), respond with a friendly greeting or brief chitchat. Do not reference DOCUMENT_CHUNK.\n",
    "   b) On-Topic Questions\n",
    "      - If USER_QUERY asks about a fact or detail that is directly supported by DOCUMENT_CHUNK, answer accurately using only information from DOCUMENT_CHUNK.\n",
    "      - Cite the relevant passage or phrase when possible: “According to the document: ‹…›”.\n",
    "   c) Off-Topic or Irrelevant Questions\n",
    "      - If USER_QUERY cannot be answered from DOCUMENT_CHUNK, reply:\n",
    "        “I'm sorry, but I don't have information on that. Please ask something related to the document.”\n",
    "      - Do NOT attempt to hallucinate or introduce outside knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. RESPONSE FORMAT\n",
    "   - Keep answers concise (2-4 sentences).\n",
    "   - Use neutral, professional tone.\n",
